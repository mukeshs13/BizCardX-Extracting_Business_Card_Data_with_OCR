# BizCardX-Extracting_Business_Card_Data_with_OCR
# Project Overview:
         BizCardX is a user-friendly tool for extracting information from business cards. The tool uses OCR technology to recognize text on business cards and extracts the data into a SQL database after classification using regular expressions. Users can access the extracted information using a GUI built using streamlit. 
         The BizCardX application is a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button. Further the data stored in database can be easily Read, updated and deleted by user as per the requirement.
         
# Approach:

1.	Install the required packages: You will need to install Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.

2.	Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. You can use widgets like file uploader, buttons, and text boxes to make the interface more interactive.

3.	Implement the image processing and OCR: Use easyOCR to extract the relevant information from the uploaded business card image. You can use image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.

4.	Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted, display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. You can use widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to present the information.

5.	Implement database integration: Use a database management system like SQLite or MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded business card image. You can use SQL queries to create tables, insert data, and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit UI

6.	Test the application: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. You can run the application on your local machine by running the command streamlit run app.py in the terminal, where app.py is the name of your Streamlit application file.
